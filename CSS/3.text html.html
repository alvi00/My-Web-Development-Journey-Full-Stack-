    <h1>The Avengers (2012 film)</h1>
    <p>
      The film's development began when Marvel Studios received a loan from
      Merrill Lynch in April 2005. After the success of the film Iron Man in May
      2008, Marvel announced that The Avengers would be released in July 2011
      and would bring together Stark (Downey), Rogers (Evans), Banner (at the
      time Edward Norton),[b] and Thor (Hemsworth) from Marvel's previous films.
      With the signing of Johansson as Romanoff in March 2009, Renner as Barton
      in June 2010, and Ruffalo replacing Norton as Banner in July 2010, the
      film was pushed back for a 2012 release. Whedon was brought on board in
      April 2010 and rewrote the original screenplay by Zak Penn. Production
      began in April 2011 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, before moving to
      Cleveland, Ohio in August and New York City in September. The film has
      more than 2,200 visual effects shots.

      In response, Fury reactivates the "Avengers Initiative". Agent Natasha
      Romanoff heads to Kolkata to recruit Dr. Bruce Banner to trace the
      Tesseract through its gamma radiation emissions. Fury approaches Steve
      Rogers to retrieve the Tesseract, and Agent Phil Coulson visits Tony Stark
      to have him check Selvig's research. Loki is in Stuttgart, where Barton
      steals the iridium needed to stabilize the Tesseract's power, leading to a
      confrontation with Rogers, Stark, and Romanoff that ends with Loki's
      surrender. While Loki gets escorted to S.H.I.E.L.D., his adoptive brother
      Thor arrives and frees him, hoping to convince him to abandon his plan and
      return to Asgard. Stark and Rogers intervene and Loki is taken to
      S.H.I.E.L.D.'s flying aircraft carrier, the Helicarrier, where he is
      imprisoned.
