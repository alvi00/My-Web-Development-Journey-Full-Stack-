let age;
age=23;
age++;
// let will help to initialize a variable
const alvi=10;
//as alvi is a constant variable so the value of it cant be changed

//so there is a fantastic thing in java script that is
//if i like assign a=10; so a is a number right and then
//i can change the type of the variable a=true;
let a=true;

//so there is string in js which is in all languagge duhhh
//so here if i can use '' and can use  ""
let lazna="alvi is a good boy";
lazna.length;
//helps to print the lengh of the string
lazna[1];
//also can access each letter like an array

//is any variable is not initilized yet then it is undefined
//or we can manually do that by using null
a=null;
