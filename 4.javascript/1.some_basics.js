//There are 7 types of data types
// number boolen string null undefined
// and here are the rest two bigint and symbol and it is not used that much
//in java script we dont have that much complecations for numbers
// like all floats, int, negative, posive, double all are number
//i dont need to intialize it will detect auto

a=10
b=10.2
sum=a+b
dif=a-b
mod=a%b
mul=a*b
exponentioan_or_power= 2**2//this means that 2^2 i means 2 square
//here ** will help to represent power
typeof a// this will print what is a , so it will print number

//so there is other thing called NAN
//here nan means not a number
//its like it is represting a number but the number is not valid
//like 0/0 is nan

alvi=0/0//it will show NAN (not a number)
typeof alvi//this will show number


// now comes the precedence
// () -> ** -> *,/,% -> +,-
